@title(Overview)
  This library is intended to provide a relatively simple means of drawing things to
  static image files. It does not yet provide a hard/fast guarantee of correctness or speed
  but in general we have done as much work as we can to make it fast and correct on those
  (at the moment) few examples that we have written and tested.
